                About Our Ranch	
            </div>
            <p>In the Year 1992, Captain Brook bought a creek-fed oasis in the Chalbi Desert of Nothern Kenya, sparking generations of integrity, preservation, and innovation called Brook Ranch.
The Ranch now covers 825,000 acres in the County of Machakos.

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
       
        <p><em>Over the course of 150 years, Brook Ranch has led some of the first cattle drives, developed the Santa Gertrudis and Santa Cruz breeds of cattle, bred the finest quarter horses, and produced champion thoroughbreds all under its iconic Running brand. Today Brook Ranch has diversified into a major agribusiness with interests in cattle ranching and feedlot operations, farming (apples, grapes, grain, sugar cane, and turfgrass), commodity marketing and processing, luxury retail goods, and recreational hunting and horse riding.
Moreover, we have a wine manufacturing division that majors on production of our amazing wines from the fruits produced from our farm; the grapes, apples and so on.
Occasionally we offer wine tasting annually to our esteemed customers and if you're a consistent and frequent customers, there are prizes for you to take home!
Brook Ranch continues to foster a culture of uncompromising quality, stewardship, and authenticity, a true testament to Captain Kingâ€™s commitment and integrity..<br>
